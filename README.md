# A posteriori error bounds for the block-Lanczos method for matrix function approximation

This repo contains all that is necessary to reproduce numerical experiments in the paper. Note that figure 3 is a visualization of the Pac-Man contour and is not related to any numerical experiments. Thus, there is no code related to figure 3 in this repo. 

## List of Contents

- `block_methods/`: functions used in figure generation
- `data/`: data generated from experiments to create each figure
- `imgs/`: generated figures
- `matrices/` matrices used to create each figure
